# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
## In this project, we collected and analysed Twitter data about the Trump and Biden 2020 campaigns.
We then: 
- turned the vector of tweets to a corpus
- cleaned the data
- turned the cleaned data into a dataframe
- compared positve tweets to negative tweets
- analyzed the most common topics 
- wrote a memo discussing the findings 
- calculated the political leanings for the battle ground states
- created a map to analyze the political leanings
- compared our map to a Wikipedia map and analyzed the differences
